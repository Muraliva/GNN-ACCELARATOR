# GNN-ACCELARATOR
A miniature Graph Neural Network (GNN) using embedded Deep Neural Network (DNN) nodes is implemented to schedule tasks in multiprocessors. The GNN is designed as a hierarchical module consisting of embedded DNNs interacting with each other in a pipelined fashion. The logic is the synthesized and placed on a layout.
